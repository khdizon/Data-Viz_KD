Line | [trends over time] [compare datasets with continuous variable] |
Bar | [compare different categories or groups] [discrete data that has distinct classes] |
Scatter | [examine the relationship between two continuous variables] [detect outliers] [identify clusters/groups] | 
Box | [compare distribution of a continuous variable across different classes] [examine summary statistics: spread/skewness/quartiles/outliers ] | 
Histogram | [data distribution] [shape of data] [skewness, variability, spread]

#### Plot Libraries
- Pandas: base data preprocessing
- Matplotlib: base visual 
- Seaborn: statistical visualizations offering attractive default aesthetics and color palettes
- Folium: create interactive and customizable maps
- Plotly: interactive and dynamic wide range of plot types and interactive features 
- PyWaffle: visualize proportional representation using squares or rectangles
